# SpikePy
This repository contains scripts that I have written to make plots for my master thesis.
These plots are mainly showing the second order susceptibility (so a matrix plot), the first order susceptibilities and
some more.

# Dependencies

# Disclaimer
The code is not checked by anyone other than myself and as such, might contain errors.
